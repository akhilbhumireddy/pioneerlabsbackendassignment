Task 1: Implement User Authentication with JWT
Objective: 
Develop user authentication functionality using JWT (JSON Web Tokens).
Requirements:

Implement JWT authentication using a Node.js framework of your choice (e.g., Express.js).
Include endpoints for user registration, login, and logout.
Secure sensitive routes by requiring authentication.
Evaluation Criteria:
Proper implementation of JWT authentication with token generation and verification.
Functional endpoints for user registration, login, and logout.
Secure access to protected routes using JWT.

Task 2: Create API Endpoints for Data Retrieval
Objective: Develop API endpoints to fetch data from a public API with filtering options.
Requirements:
Utilize Node.js and Express.js to create API routes.
Fetch data from the provided public API (https://api.publicapis.org/entries).
Implement filtering options for data retrieval based on categories and result limits.
Evaluation Criteria:
Successful integration of API endpoints for data retrieval.
Proper implementation of filtering options for categories and result limits.
Error handling for invalid requests and edge cases.

Task 3: Implement Swagger Documentation

Task 4: Secure API Endpoint for Authenticated Users Only
Objective: Restrict access to an API endpoint to authenticated users only.
Requirements:
Create a new API endpoint that returns a message or data.
Implement middleware to verify JWT authentication before allowing access.
Return an error message for unauthenticated requests.
Evaluation Criteria:
Successful implementation of middleware to verify JWT authentication.
Proper restriction of API endpoint to authenticated users only.
Correct error handling for unauthenticated requests.


Submission Guidelines:
- Provide a GitHub repository link containing the code for the tasks.
- Optionally, provide a hosted link (e.g., on GitHub Pages, Netlify, etc.) where the assessment can be interactively viewed.

Evaluation for each task will be based on completing requirements, code quality, adherence to best practices, and overall presentation. You must include the GitHub and optional hosted links in your submission. If you need further clarification or assistance, feel free to reach out to manidhar@procial.network .
